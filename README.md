# EXP.NO.2-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-DIGITAL-MODULATION-TECHNIQUES

## AIM    
 To Study and Realize ASK,FSK and PSK Modulation and Demodulation using the Digital Modulation Trainer Kit. 
 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED

Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V) 

## PROCEDURE
```
1.Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK):

Connect the ASK modulator section of the digital modulation trainer kit.

Apply a digital binary input signal (data input) to the modulator.

Observe the carrier signal and input data waveform on the Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO).

Connect the modulated output of the ASK modulator to the DSO and observe the ASK modulated waveform.

Now, connect the ASK demodulator section.

Feed the ASK modulated signal to the input of the demodulator.

Observe the demodulated output waveform on the DSO and compare it with the original input data.

2. Frequency Shift Keying (FSK):

Connect the FSK modulator section of the trainer kit.

Apply the digital data signal as input to the modulator.

Observe the two frequencies (representing binary 1 and 0) of the FSK modulated signal on the DSO.

Connect the FSK demodulator section.

Feed the FSK modulated signal to the input of the demodulator.

Observe the demodulated output on the DSO and compare it with the original input data.

3. Phase Shift Keying (PSK):

Connect the PSK modulator section of the trainer kit.

Provide the digital input data signal to the PSK modulator.

Observe the phase variations (representing logic 1 and 0) in the PSK modulated output using the DSO.

Connect the PSK demodulator section.

Apply the PSK modulated signal to the demodulator input.

View the demodulated output waveform and compare it with the original input data.
